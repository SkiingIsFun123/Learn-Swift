## Data Types of the Swift Programming Language

### String
In Swift, a string represents ````text````

Strings are wrapped in double quotes like this ````"Hello World!"````

To define a variable with a string value, use ````var myString = "This is my variable"````

**Project:** Make a variable that contains "Hello World!" as a string value


### Integer
In Swift, an integer represents a ````number```` value

Integers can be positive or negative but cannot contain a decimal value

Integers cannot be wrapped in double quotes and should be represented as just a regular number like ````4````

To define a variable with an integer value, use ````var myInteger = 4````

**Project:** Make a variable that contains your favorite number as an integer value


### Float


### Double


### Boolean
In Swift, a boolean represents ````true```` or ````false````

Booleans are useful because they can be used to change what runs in the program depending if a condition is met or not

To define a variable with an boolean value, use ````var myBoolean = true````

**Project:** Make a variable that contains if the weather is cloudy outside today as an boolean value


### Character
In Swift, a character represents a ````single string character````

Characters can only hold a single character and, if you try to assign more text to them, you will recieve an error

To define a variable with an character value, use ````var myCharacter: Character = "a"````

**Project:** Make a variable that contains a letter as an character value
