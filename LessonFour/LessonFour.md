Set the name to anything you want and make sure the ````Interface```` value is ````Storyboard```` and ````Language```` is ````Swift````

Click the "Next" button and store the app somewhere on your computer

If it worked properly, you should see a screen like this

## Initial run
Open the file on the right side of the screen that is titled "ViewController"

Go under the "viewDidLoad()" function and, within the parenthesis, add a print statement to print a message

Compile and run the code on a virtual iOS device py pressing the arrow button on the top left of the screen

A virtual device should launch with a white screen and the output on the Xcode side of things should have your message written in it

**Congratulations! You have just taken a huge step towards learning app development!**
