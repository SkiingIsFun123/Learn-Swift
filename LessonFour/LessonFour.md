# Your First Swift App

## Setup
To setup the app for development, first launch Xcode

Go to the nav bar at the top of the screen and click File > New > Project...

Double click the app button

Set the name to anything you want and make sure the ````Interface```` value is ````Storyboard```` and ````Language```` is ````Swift````

Click the "Next" button and store the app somewhere on your computer

If it worked properly, you should see a screen like this

## Initial run
Open the file on the right side of the screen that is titled "ViewController"

Go under the "viewDidLoad()" function and, within the parenthesis, add a print statement to print a message

Compile and run the code on a virtual iOS device py pressing the arrow button on the top left of the screen

A virtual device should launch with a white screen and the output on the Xcode side of things should have your message written in it

**Congratulations! You have just taken a huge step towards learning app development!**

## Accessing the Storyboard
Tap the button on the top right of the screen with the plus sign in a rounded box as its icon

You should see that you have another view on the right side of your screen

We are now going to change the view from the viewcontroller to the storyboard where we can place our elements

Tap the ViewControoller button on the right side of the screen and scoll down to Main > Main (Base) and click the option

You should arrive at a screen like this with the code editor on the left side and the storyboard on the right side of the screen

Now you are all set to start adding UI elements to your app

## Basic UIKit Elements
We will start by adding a label to the app and then customize its text

To add the label, click the plus button on the top right of the screen and then drag the "Label" button (first option) onto the white iPhone screen

Center the label in the middle of the screen and then click on the label

You can now customize the label's properties on the right side of the screen

**Project:** Explore and mess around with the properties of the label using the menu to add custom text and increase the font size of the label

Open the menu on the left side of the screen by clicking on "iPod Touch 7" to change the target simulator device to "iPhone 11" anc click that option

Compile and run the app by pressing the arrow button on the top left side of the screen to ensure you followed the steps properly

You should get an output like this
