## Switches


## If Statements
An if statement can help you control the way a program operates depending on if a specific condition or set of conditions are met

An example of an if statement using non programming terms is ````if it's raining now```` then ````close the windows````

In Swift, if statements are used by typing ````if````, ````else if````, and ````else````

An example of an if statement block of code is:
````
var rainyOutside = true

if rainyOutside == true {
    let areWindowsClosed = true
}
else if rainyOutside == false {
    let areWindowsClosed = false
}
else {
    let areWindowsClosed = false
}
````

**Project:** Define the variable "currentWeather" and set the value equal to "rainy". Then, write an if statement that checks if the weather is rainy, sunny, or something else and prints a different output depending on the current weather value
