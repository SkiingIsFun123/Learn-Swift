### The Swift Programming Language

## Variables

A variable is a value that can be altered depending on changes in the program or specific changes.

In Swift, like every other programming language, variables are essential to making a program that works effectively.

To define a variable in Swift, you will use the ````var```` keyword.

**Project:** Make a variable that contains your favorite website and change the value in the next line.

## Constants

Unlike a variable, a constant cannot be altered within the program and will throw an error if the program attempts to change its value.

Constants are useful because they allow programmers to have values they know will stay the same throughout the program no matter what happens.

To define a constant in Swift, you will use the ````let```` keyword.

**Project:** Make a constant that contains what your favorite movie is.
