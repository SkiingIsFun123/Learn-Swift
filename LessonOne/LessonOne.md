## The Basics of the Swift Programming Language

### Variables

A variable is a value that can be altered depending on changes in the program.

In Swift, like every other programming language, variables are essential to making a program that works effectively.

To define a variable in Swift, you will use the ````var```` keyword.

**Project:** Make a variable that contains your favorite website and change the value in the next line.

### Constants

Unlike a variable, a constant cannot be altered within the program and will throw an error if the program attempts to change its value.

Constants are useful because they allow programmers to have values they know will stay the same throughout the program no matter what happens.

To define a constant in Swift, you will use the ````let```` keyword.

**Project:** Make a constant that contains what your favorite movie is.

### Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple items of the same type of data.

Arrays are useful because they can be modified easily and specific items within the array can be chosen very easily.

**Project:** Make an array that contains what your favorite foods are.

Arrays can be an easy way to access data.

The index of an array always starts at ````0```` for swift and this will obtain the first value in the array.

The index can be increased or decreased to find other elements in the array.

**Project:** Get the first food from the array data and store it to a variable.

To add an item to an array, use the name of the array then append with what you want to add in parenthesis ````food.append("pineapple")````

### Dictionaries
