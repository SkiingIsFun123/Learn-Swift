### Getting started with Swift

## Downloading Xcode

To use the Swift programming language in the easiest way possible, you will need to download Xcode.

To do this, first open the App Store on your Mac device.

Type in the search bar "Xcode" and click the install button on the result shown below with the hammer and blueprint in the background.

The download should take a little while depending on your wifi connection, so leave it running and come back to the turotial once it finishes.

Once the download is finished, launch Xcode.

Go to the navigation bar and click File > New > Playground... and then click "Blank" and "Next"
